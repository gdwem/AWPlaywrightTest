## Instructions:

Note - if using VSCode it helps to have the playwright plugin installed, see here for more info https://playwright.dev/docs/intro

 - run **`npm install`** from the root of the project folder in the terminal
 - if playwright plugin is not installed run **`npx playwright test`** from the root of the project folder in the terminal 
 - otherwise click on the testing tab and then the 'Run Tests' button (play icon)
 - run **`npx playwright show-report`** to generate a report after the test has run (browser should open with new tab)
